# LLM Chain made in Rails

This project is a sample app with API that uses openai, langchain and vectoreStore Qdrant. Basically we can give the model information that will be stored inside a vectore store and we can ask question about that. The model will always search in the vector store for additional information so it will remember all the data given always.

Some good applications for this model is to upload large pdf archives and store all of it in a vectore database, so you can ask the model for information inside the pdf or any other type of document
